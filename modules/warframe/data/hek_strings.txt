WHY are these FOOLS still breathing **MY AIR**!?
**THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE**!
**MUST I DO EVERYTHING MYSELF**?!
I knew this day would come. I prepared, changed myself. I made sacrifices! Tenno... are you ready for a **SACRIFICE**?!
The first Grineer... who brings me the head of a Tenno... will be permitted... **TO WEAR ITS SKULL AS A HELMET**!
Tick, tock. Tick, tock. **TICK, TOCK, TENNO**!
Oh, look what we have here! More fertilizer for our Grineer gardens! Your worm-bloated corpse will blend nicely with the excrement on my crops!
It's... beautiful... it's so beautiful... **KILL IT**!
You have not won, maggots... **YOU HAVE NOT WON**!
Keep trying to cleanse these Plains! You'll only die... in a shower... of feculent... **DEFEAT**!
My favourite ghoul is... **THE ONE THAT RIPS YOUR MAGGOT HEAD OFF!**
Ghouls, wake! Time to play. Time... **TO KILL**.
My ghouls kill to live, and live to kill. And kill, **AND KILL**!
Come out, come out, come out! Meet your **NEW FRIENDS**! It’s **SLAYTIME**!
Like all parents I want a future for my children. As long as that future involves **DEAD TENNO MAGGOTS**!
My ghouls came from bags. YOU! **WILL LEAVE IN THEM**!
Ah, I love that new ghoul smell, fresh from the bag."
