WHY are these FOOLS still breathing **MY AIR**!?
**THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE**!
**MUST I DO EVERYTHING MYSELF**?!
I knew this day would come. I prepared, changed myself. I made sacrifices! Tenno... are you ready for a **SACRIFICE**?!
The first Grineer... who brings me the head of a Tenno... will be permitted... **TO WEAR ITS SKULL AS A HELMET**!
Tick, tock. Tick, tock. **TICK, TOCK, TENNO**!
Oh, look what we have here! More fertilizer for our Grineer gardens! Your worm-bloated corpse will blend nicely with the excrement on my crops!
It's... beautiful... it's so beautiful... **KILL IT**!
You have not won, maggots... **YOU HAVE NOT WON**!
Keep trying to cleanse these Plains! You'll only die... in a shower... of feculent... **DEFEAT**!
My favourite ghoul is... **THE ONE THAT RIPS YOUR MAGGOT HEAD OFF!**
Ghouls, wake! Time to play. Time... **TO KILL**.
My ghouls kill to live, and live to kill. And kill, **AND KILL**!
Come out, come out, come out! Meet your **NEW FRIENDS**! Itâ€™s **SLAYTIME**!
Like all parents I want a future for my children. As long as that future involves **DEAD TENNO MAGGOTS**!
My ghouls came from bags. YOU! **WILL LEAVE IN THEM**!
Ah, I love that new ghoul smell, fresh from the bag.
TENNO **BONES** will be the foundation, of GRINEER **HOMES**!
NO MERCY FOR TENNO, NO MERCY FOR THEIR LOTUS!
The TENNO! HATE! OUR SUPERIORITY! We will put them OUT of their **JEALOUS MISERY**!
DEATH! DEATH! DEATH! DEATH TO THE TENNO!
Our Queens demand JUSTICE for your trespasses, Tenno!
The Lotus is JUST ANOTHER WEED, to be **PLUCKED** AND DISCARDED!
The Tenno have come to **DESTROY** OUR WAY OF LIFE! Stop them, at ALL COSTS!
**BROTHERS**! Do not let the Tenno THREATEN OUR DESTINY!
TENNO! You are only delaying the inevitable.
Only a small setback, **insignificant** against the tide of Grineer will!
DOWN WITH THE OROKIN WEEDS! **DOWN WITH THE TENNO!**
Be warned. Failure to stop the Tenno, will result in YOUR failure, to **CONTINUE BREATHING**!
Hehehahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA... **HA HA HA HA HA HA HAHAHAHAHAHA**! ***RAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAH***!!
These criminals, think they are committing a JUSTICE... HAH. Not in **MY** court!
GRINEER BROTHERS! I've done MY part! Now clean up this... **MESS**.
I am too important for this nonsense! FINISH THEM OFF!
Now we finish this business. **ONCE AND FOR AAALL**!!
Kill... Kill... KILL! **KILL THE TENNO SCUM**!!
You TENNO. Are such a WASTE. Of perfectly good **VIOLENCE**!
For TOO LONG, the Corpus, have extorted the Grineer! **Frohd Bek**. Consider. Our contracts. CANCELLED. THIS! IS A **HOSTILE TAKEOVER**!
Hello... *insects*.
**HAHAHAHAHAHA**! Even **I** didn't think it would be THIS. EASY! Are you INSECTS even **TRYING**?
Take a deep breath, Tenno! YOU DON'T HAVE MANY LEFT!
If at first you don't succeed. DIE, DIE AGAIN!
Failure comes SO EASY to you, Tenno.
This is far, **FAR** FROM OVER!!
Poor Tenno, hehehe. No Lotus, to THINK FOR YOU?
Ooh, is it my birth interval?! Such a GIFT! But, I have a surprise for YOU, you GREASY METAL **MAGGOT**! HAHAHAHAHAHA!
WHAT?! YOU PATHETIC! MEAT! **PILES**! CAN'T YOU STOP **ONE**?! **PUNY**?! ***MAGGOT***?! FROM SQUIRMING *AWAY*?! AAAARGH!!!
You have not won, maggots... **YOU HAVE NOT WON**!
